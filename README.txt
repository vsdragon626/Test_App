This is for assignment B in software engineering.

This app was created as a means to familiarize myself with the way android interacts with the phones,
and the page creation, in addition to learning how to use activities.  

basically to get a taste of whats to come.

In this particular app I went a little above what was expected since there was no requirement on what
the content should be I added pictures to each screen, then on top of that the last two screens have
added content to them.  The second screen being a clock which was simply a drag and drop venture.
The third screen was the most interesting and time consuming of the three screens, in this one I
added sound which in the long run wasn't difficult, but it caused a bunch of errors when I tried
different things.  Ultimately there was a fairly obvious solution in the API.

The moral of the story is always start with the API.
